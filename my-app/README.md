# React UI Schema Form Renderer

This React application enables users to paste a UI schema in a JSON editor and preview a dynamically rendered form based on that schema. The application's main screen is divided into two equal sections: a JSON editor on the left and a form preview on the right.

## Features

- **JSON Editor**: Paste your UI schema in JSON format.
- **Dynamic Form Rendering**: Automatically renders a form based on the provided UI schema.
